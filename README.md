# 7 Days, 7 Projects - Pathfinding Visualizer (Day 1/7)

Graphical User Interface built using React Framework to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms. Feel free to fork or download this project if you would like to try this out or use this code as the base to create your own Pathfinding Visualizer.

[Live Demo](https://jamiejarrettjj.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/ "Live Demo")

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Algorithm
3. Breadth First Search
4. Depth First Search
5. Bogo Spread
6. Random Spread
